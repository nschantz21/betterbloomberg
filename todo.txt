rethink the file structure of the package.
The data requests should maybe be their own sub module.
I am not sure what I would put in the core file then.
I'm not sure there are core functions necessary, 
since each type of request seems to require its own type of processing.

unit testing for each class, or suite for each class

I could add a kind of function dictionary to make the final interface a bit easier.
Something like betterbloomberg.get_data(request_type, **kwargs)
